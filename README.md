# Development of Customer Churn Prediction Model in the Telecommunications Industry for Customer Retention Optimization

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Telco customer churn prediction project. In the telecommunications industry, customer churn is a common problem that can have a significant impact on business revenue, market share, and customer acquisition costs. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can classify customers as churn or non-churn based on various features. By accurately predicting churn, the company can take appropriate retention strategies and minimize operational costs.

## Problem Statement

The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify Telco customers as churn or non-churn, enabling the company to optimize retention strategies with minimal operational costs.

## Business Benefits

- **Improved Customer Retention**: With an accurate churn prediction model, the company can identify customers at high risk of churn and implement effective retention strategies tailored to their needs.

- **Increased Revenue**: Reducing churn effectively can lead to higher customer retention, resulting in increased revenue as existing customers continue to use the company's services.

- **Cost Reduction**: By identifying customers who are unlikely to churn, the company can avoid unnecessary retention efforts, reducing operational costs.

- **Personalized Marketing**: The churn prediction model can also enable the company to develop personalized marketing strategies, enhancing customer satisfaction and long-term relationships.

## Conclusion

The project has successfully developed a churn prediction model using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The best-performing algorithm, Catboost, was selected, and a Random Over Sampling technique was applied to address class imbalance. The chosen evaluation metrics, F2 Score and Recall, prioritize minimizing the risk of false negatives while considering model precision.

However, it is important to note that the churn prediction model should not be the sole decision-making tool. Business knowledge, experience, and human judgment should complement the model's results, allowing for a balanced and context-aware decision-making process.

## Business Recommendations

Based on the results of the churn prediction model, the following business recommendations are suggested:

1. **Improve Customer Service and Support**: Focus on enhancing the customer experience by providing high-quality service and support. Quick and adequate assistance during customer issues or inquiries can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

2. **Segment Customers**: Segment customers based on churn risk using the model's predictions. Target high-risk customers with tailored retention efforts, such as incentives, special offers, or customized service packages.

3. **Analyze Other Influential Factors**: Investigate additional factors that may impact customer churn, such as service pricing, network quality, internet speed, and overall customer satisfaction. Addressing these factors can further reduce churn rates.

4. **Collect Customer Feedback**: After implementing retention strategies, collect feedback from customers who still decide to churn. Understanding their reasons for leaving can provide valuable insights for continuous improvement.

By implementing these recommendations, the company can expect to improve customer retention, reduce churn, and ultimately increase revenue while optimizing operational costs.
